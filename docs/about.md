# About

A **Scratch-inspired 2D game engine** for **TypeScript**.
Type-safe, lightweight, and fun — bring the simplicity of Scratch into real code.

This is a new open source project. It is maintained by me, a 14 year old student.
If anyone has suggestions, feedback, or improvement ideas, feel free to contact me

It's main purpose is to introduce real programming for kids. In most schools,
children code on the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) platform, where they drag
blocks, such as `move (10) steps`, `point in direction (80°)` etc. TScratch provides
a high abstraction on top of the HTML canvas with a Scratch-like API, so that the
children can smoothly transition from dragging blocks, into coding in real
programming languages.
